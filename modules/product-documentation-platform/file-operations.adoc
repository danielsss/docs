Here I want to document the behaviour of file operations on all platforms.


=== Delete Files and Folders

Deleting files is a destructive operation, so a warning needs to be shown and confirmed by users.

=== Move Files and Folders

A move action should open a file browser view, where users can coose the target directory.

=== Copy Files and Folders

A copy action should open a file browser view, where users can coose the target directory.

=== Name Conflicts

If file or folder names from uploads conflict with existing names, ownCloud should offer the following options:

- Add the item as a new version (files only)
- Add the item with a modified name (tbd)
- Overwrite the existing file or folder

=== Permission Problems

- â€¦
