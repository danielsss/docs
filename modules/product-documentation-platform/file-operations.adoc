Here I want to document the behaviour of file operations on all platforms.


=== Delete files and folders

Deleting files is a destructive operation, so a warning needs to be shown and confirmed by users.

=== Move files and folders

A move action should open a file browser view, where users can coose the target directory.

=== Copy files and folders

A copy action should open a file browser view, where users can coose the target directory.

=== Name conflicts

If file or folder names from uploads conflict with existing names, ownCloud should offer the following options:

- Add the item as a new version (files only)
- Add the item with a modified name (tbd)
- Overwrite the existing file or folder

=== Permission problems

- â€¦
